# The Journey — From First Line to Final Product

## TESTING JOURNEY (TDD with Jest)

      1. SETUP
      Initialized with npm init -y
      Installed Jest: npm install --save-dev jest
      Got inotify platform error
      Ignored safely (non-blocking on Windows)

      2. FILE STRUCTURE
      Created:
         src/Sweet.js
         src/Inventory.js
         tests/inventory.test.js

      3. WROTE FIRST TEST
      Test: should add a sweet to inventory
      Cannot find module '../src/Inventory'
      Fixed: Created Inventory.js and imported properly

      4. ERRORS I SOLVED
      Issue	Fix
      Sweet is not defined	✅ Imported Sweet at top
      puchaseSweet() typo	✅ Renamed to purchaseSweet()
      .toLowerCase() on undefined	✅ Added null checks
      Logic error in test (wrong expectation)	✅ Corrected values

   5. FEATURE WISE TESTS
      | Feature                | Test | Errors                       | Status |
      | ---------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | ------ |
      | `addSweet()`           | ✅    | –                            | ✅      |
      | `deleteSweet()`        | ✅    | wrong ID used                | ✅      |
      | `searchByName()`       | ✅    | compared ID instead of count | ✅      |
      | `searchByCategory()`   | ✅    | `undefined.toLowerCase()`    | ✅      |
      | `searchByPriceRange()` | ✅    | expected wrong value         | ✅      |
      | `purchaseSweet()`      | ✅    | typo in method               | ✅      |
      | `restockSweet()`       | ✅    | –                            | ✅      |
      `sortBy()`|	✅ |	Logic bug|	✅

       
       6. Added Sorting Feature (Backend)
      Introduced sortBy(field, direction) method inside Inventory.js 
   Allowed sorting by:
   
name (alphabetically)

price (numerically)

quantity (stock units)

   ## FINAL TEST STATUS
      100% test coverage
      Clean logs, error handling, and code
      Proper folder structure
      Commits made per feature with clear messages

   ##  FRONTEND JOURNEY (HTML/CSS/JS)
      
      1. Basic Setup
      Created index.html and style.css
      Designed form + layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox
      Used <script type="module"> for ES imports

      2. Loader Setup
      Designed animated CSS loader
      Loader never disappears
      Fixed: added window.onload → hide loader after 1.5s

      3.  JS Modules: Inventory & Sweet
      export default missing → Uncaught SyntaxError
      Added export default in both Inventory.js & Sweet.js
      Created logic for: Add, Delete, Purchase, Restock

      4. Search & Filter
      Implemented filters:
         By Name
         By Category
         By Price Range
      Price filter bug: NaN
      Fixed using parseFloat() and isNaN() checks

      5.  Responsive Design
      Looks great on desktop
      Added media queries for mobile (<768px)
      Added separate breakpoints for iPad (768–1024px)
      Inputs resize well, cards stack or wrap naturally
      
      6. Sorting Feature
      Added sorting dropdowns for Name, Price, Quantity
      Supports both Ascending & Descending orders
      Faced issue: sorting and filtering were overriding each other
      Solved it by combining logic in a unified applyFiltersAndSorting() function


# TOTAL ERRORS SOLVED
| Area                     | Count |
| ------------------------ | ----- |
| Jest Setup Errors        | 3     |
| JS Logic Errors          | 4     |
| Import / Typo            | 2     |
| Loader / DOM Errors      | 2     |
|Sorting and Filtering Conflict|1  |
| Responsive layout tuning | 3     |
| TOTAL                    | 14+   |

# FINAL STATUS
```bash
Fully working backend (TDD)
Fully interactive frontend UI
Polished mobile & tablet responsive layout
Sorting integrated into both frontend and testable backend
Responsive design works perfectly across devices
Clean commits & structured repo
Project is presentation-ready 
```
